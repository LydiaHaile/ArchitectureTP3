### Instructions: all database implementations at once
- In the root of this directory run the command
  *./run_test.sh*

- If permissions error occurs - make the "run_test.sh" file an executable by running 

  *chmod +x run_test.sh*
  
  then, run the first command once again. 

### Instructions: all database implementations at individually 
To run the tests on the different database implementations indivudually follow the instructions listed below. 
_OrientDB_
- In the root of this directory run the command
  
  *./orientdb_test.sh*

- If permissions error occurs - make the "orientdb_test.sh" file an executable by running 

  *chmod +x orientdb_test.sh*
  
  then, run the first command once again. 

_MongoDB_ 
- In the root of this directory run the command 

  *./mongodb_test.sh*
  
- If permissions error occurs - make the "mongodb_test.sh" file an executable by running 
  
  *chmod +x mongodb_test.sh*
  
  then, run the first command once again. 

_Redis_
- In the root of this directory run the command 

  *./redis_test.sh*
  
- If permissions error occurs - make the "redis_test.sh" file an executable by running 
  
  *chmod +x redis_test.sh*
  
  then, run the first command once again. 

### Results
The results of each test can be found in the directory "results" after running the tests. Each database implementation has its own folder of results within the results directory. Furhtermore, there are seperate folders allocated for each workloads run (Workload A and Workload B).
